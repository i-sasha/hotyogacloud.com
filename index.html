		"...whether young, old or too old, sick or lean, one who discards laziness, gets success if he practices Yoga."<br /><br />--- Hatha Yoga Pradipika,

	   <p>I practice and teach <b>Bishnu Yoga&reg;</b>, which is rooted in the <b>Bikram/Bishnu Ghosh Yoga Tradition</b> from Calcutta, India.<br /><br /> 
		<b>Bishnu Yoga&reg; Series</b> is <b>scientifically designed to work on the entire body</b> in a balanced and thorough fashion, developing strength, 
			flexibility, balance and the power of concentration. 
		<b>Based on the same 26 yoga exercises as Bikram Yoga</b>, it is a whole body yoga workout, developing and maintaining <b>internal physical fitness and 
			health</b>.<br /><br />Faithful and correct practice of this yoga <b>keeps the body young and healthy all life long, free of old age symptoms and conditions.</b>
			This yoga method will bring <b>sure and definite results to those who practice in a steady, regular and long-term fashion</b>.<br /><br />
        	A little bit about me. My name is <b>Sasha</b>. I was the person to <b>Pioneer the Hot Yoga Movement in Canada</b>, by introducing <b>Bikram Yoga</b> to 
            Toronto, Canada in 1992. I have owned and operated <b>Canada's oldest Hot Yoga studio</b> for over 25 years, accumulating <b>over 30,000 hours of daily teaching 
            and over 15,000 hours of daily personal practice</b>.<br /><br />From my extensive personal experience I can tell you that <b>this yoga works wonders</b>!</p>
