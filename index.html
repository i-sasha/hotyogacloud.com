		"...whether young, old or too old, sick or lean, one who discards laziness, gets success if he practices Yoga."<br /><br />--- Hatha Yoga Pradipika, 
                translation by Muktibodhananda Saraswati</h4>
	<br /><br />
        <p><hr /></p>

	   <p>I practice the <b>Hot Basic (30+2)</b> yoga class.<br /><br /> 
		<b>Based on the same 26+2 yoga exercises as Bikram Yoga</b>, and like the Bikram Yoga series, <b>Hot Basic</b> is also a whole body yoga workout, on a more 
		<b>Intermediate Level</b>, developing and maintaining <b>internal physical fitness and health</b>.<br /><br />Faithful and correct practice 
		<b>keeps the body young and healthy all life long, free of old age symptoms and conditions.</b>
		This yoga method will bring <b>sure and definite results to those who practice in a steady, regular and long-term fashion</b>.<br /><br />

        	A little bit about me. My name is <b>Sasha</b>. I was the person to <b>Pioneer the Hot Yoga Movement in Canada</b>, by introducing <b>Bikram Yoga</b> to 
            Toronto, Canada in 1992. I have owned and operated <b>Canada's oldest Hot Yoga studio</b> for over 25 years, accumulating <b>over 30,000 hours of daily teaching 
            and over 18,000 hours of daily personal practice</b>.<br /><br />From my extensive personal experience I can tell you that <b>this yoga works wonders</b>!</p>
        </p>
