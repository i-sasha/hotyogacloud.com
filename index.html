		"...whether young, old or too old, sick or lean, one who discards laziness, gets success if he practices Yoga."<br /><br />--- Hatha Yoga Pradipika, 
                translation by Muktibodhananda Saraswati</h4>
	<br /><br />
        <p><hr /></p>

	   <p>I practice and teach the <b>Bikram Yoga Method</b> and the <b>Hot Basic</b> yoga classes, both based on the <b>Bishnu Ghosh Yoga Tradition</b> from Calcutta, India.<br /><br /> 
		<b>Bikram Yoga Series</b> is <b>scientifically designed to work on the entire body</b> in a balanced and thorough fashion, developing strength, 
			flexibility, balance and the power of concentration. 
		<b>Based on the same 26+2 yoga exercises as Bikram Yoga</b>, and like the Bikram Yoga series, Hot Basic is also a whole body yoga workout, developing and maintaining <b>internal physical fitness and 
			health</b>.<br /><br />Faithful and correct practice <b>keeps the body young and healthy all life long, free of old age symptoms and conditions.</b>
			These yoga methods will bring <b>sure and definite results to those who practice in a steady, regular and long-term fashion</b>.<br /><br />

            <b>Bikram Yoga is Hot Yoga</b>. Bikram Choudhury stresses that it is supposed to be practiced in a hot environment.<br /><br />Typically, Bikram Yoga studios are instructed 
            to keep the classroom at <b>105F and 40% humidity</b> level. This is a <b>deep and intensive</b> practice. At home one needs to approach it carefully and slowly, since none of us have a 
            specially built HOT room.<br /><br />For those people who are not comfortable practicing the <b>Bikram class at low heat</b>, I also offer a slightly modified Bikram Method that 
            I called the <b>Hot Basic</b> Class.<br /><br />

            There is a Sun Salutation at the start, and also another 'non-Bikram' pose near the end. Plus there are some subtle adjustments in sequence to avoid spasms, that may result from 
            going too deep at cooler temps.<br /><br />

            These adjustments are meant to make the yoga practice <b>suitable and safer for practice in low heat</b>. Good to have some variety.<br /> 
            <b>Always good to have some heat</b>! <b>Try it out</b>! :-) <br /><br />


        	A little bit about me. My name is <b>Sasha</b>. I was the person to <b>Pioneer the Hot Yoga Movement in Canada</b>, by introducing <b>Bikram Yoga</b> to 
            Toronto, Canada in 1992. I have owned and operated <b>Canada's oldest Hot Yoga studio</b> for over 25 years, accumulating <b>over 30,000 hours of daily teaching 
            and over 16,000 hours of daily personal practice</b>.<br /><br />From my extensive personal experience I can tell you that <b>this yoga works wonders</b>!</p>
        </p>
