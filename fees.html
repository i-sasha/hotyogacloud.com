		"Since ancient times it (hatha yoga) has been used by yogis and rishis for the relief and elimination of all kinds of diseases and defects. It
           is true that the practices require more time and effort on the part of the patient than conventional therapies, but in terms of permanent,
           positive results, as well as saving the enormous expenditure on medicines, they are certainly more worthwile. What makes this method of treatment
           so powerful and effective is the fact that it works according to the principles of harmony and unification, rather than diversity."<br />
           -- Hatha Yoga Pradipika, translation by Muktibodhananda Saraswati</h4>
