			"What is desirable in body culture is the harmonious development of power over the voluntary action of muscles and the involuntary processes of
           		heart, lungs, stomach and other organs and important glands. This is what gives health, and is the scientific principle underlying the Yoga
           		exercises."<br /><br />--- Bishnu Ghosh</h4>
	<br />
        <p><hr /></p>


	<h2>My style of teaching is known for its high quality instruction and high standards.</h2>
		<p>In our yoga practice we strive to develop and strengthen our body, mind and spirit. We aim to achieve this by lovingly disciplining ourselves during our yoga practice to become the 
		best person we can be. Both self-love and self-discipline are needed. By themselves alone, these qualities lead to unhealthy extremes; while fusing strength and sensitivity leads 
		to a balance.</p>
		<p>I welcome and invite all yoga students to consciously participate in improving themselves on an ongoing basis. Let your practice room be your own ashram 
		(centre for learning and practice)!</p>
        <p><hr /></p>
        <h2>Yoga and Health</h2>
        <p>The concept of harmonizing the twofold energies in man is very important for health considerations, because the two forces remain in an unbalanced 
           and unharmonized state. Either the prana shakti is dominant or the mental shakti, and the other one is subservient. Due to this imbalance, either 
           physical or mental diseases manifest.</p>
        <p><hr /></p>

        <h2>My Yoga Tradition</h2>
        <p>Our yoga lineage can be traced to a series codified by the Nath sect between the 5th and 10th century. A.D. The Nath sect was founded by Yogi Matsyendranath, 
           regarded as the first human teacher of hatha yoga. Matsyendranath's chief disciple, Gorakhnath, was guru to Yogi Swatmarama, who compiled the wisdom and techniques of 
           hatha yoga in the Hatha Yoga Pradipikas.</p><br />

        <p id="p2">Swami Sivananda Saraswati</p><br />
        <p>Over the centuries this lineage was passed down to Swami Sivananda Saraswati of Rishikesh Ashram in the Himalayas. Sivananda worked closely with Bishnu Charan Ghosh 
           to help him develop a system of hatha yoga asanas for health and fitness, based on the original classic 84 postures.</p><br />

        <p>Bishnu Charan Ghosh, youngest brother of Paramahansa Yogananda - author of the best selling Autobiography of a Yogi, established Ghosh's College of Physical Education in 1924, 
           in Calcutta. Bishnu was trained at an early age in the arts of yoga and meditation at the Ranchi School for Boys founded in 1917 by Paramahansa Yogananda. Ghosh became a celebrated 
            physical culturalist in India and abroad. He traveled world wide and gave amazing demonstrations of mind's control over body. Bishnu's son Biswanath (Bisu) Ghosh followed 
            in his father's footsteps. Bisu's daughter Muktamala is now in charge of Ghosh's College.</p><br />

        <p id="p2">Bikram Choudhury</p><br />
        <p>Bikram Choudhury, one of Bishnu Ghosh's most talented students, opened his Yoga College of India headquarters in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles in 1965. 
            Bikram developed his series of 26 postures, based on the main 84 taught by his Guru Bishnu Ghosh. He named it Bikram Yoga, a beginner level class.</p><br />

        <p>My yoga tradition is the Bishnu Ghosh Yoga tradition. These yoga series are highly effective therapeutic yoga methods. 
           They work synergistically and cumulatively to return the body to a balanced state. The warm environment relaxes the body and helps prevent injury. These exercises 
            systematically move refreshed and oxygenated blood to one hundred percent of your body, thus driving circulation to each organ and fiber within you, and restoring all systems 
            to healthy working order. Proper weight, muscle tone, vibrant good health, and a sense of well-being will automatically follow.<br />
	   <br />I have undergone an intense 4 month Teacher Training with Bikram in 1994, being among the first few in the world to do so.<br />Since then, I have personally trained dozens of hot 
		 yoga teachers and introduced many thousands of people to the health benefits of yoga practice. I believe in simplicity and effectiveness of life style and practice.<br />
            My favourite mantra is - "Simple living and high thinking" 
                (by my Teacher Paramahansa Yogananda).
